## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on social media data. This involves:
- Collecting data (tweets) using the Twitter API.
- Performing sentiment analysis using pre-trained NLP models.
- Refining the model to enhance its performance.

## Features
- **Synthetic Data Generation**: Create synthetic social media data for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze the sentiment of social media posts.
- **Model Refinement**: Improve model accuracy through fine-tuning.
